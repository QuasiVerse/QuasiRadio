I want to mention the reason I put time into the encryption of a song instead of being similar to i-tunes/spotify and allow for download after purchase with no encryption. I created the Erc721/NFT exchange so that someone could buy a song and then sell it on the market back if they choose to get rid of the song and in doing so they no longer have access to the key/IV to open the file even if previously downloaded. This would boost sales in the radio industry and still allow for monitoring and controlling the sales so the respective owner gets a percentage.
