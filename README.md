Thank you for taking the time to look at the code, I took time to re-evaluate your question on what would stop someone from creating a smart contract that would access the URI and find the key/IV. I would like to say that even if someone created a smart contract, they would have to get each individual URI per song and get the key/iv within and then add it into a new ERC721 token in a seperate smart contract. So they would have to purchase each song to be able to get the original key/IV.

I also want to mention the reason I put time into the encryption of a song instead of being similar to i-tunes/spotify and allow for download after purchase with no encryption. I created the Erc721 exchange so that someone could buy a song and then sell it on the market back if they choose to get rid of the song and in doing so they no longer have access to the key/IV to open the file even if previously downloaded. This would boost sales in the radio industry and still allow for monitoring and controlling the sales so the respective owner gets a percentage.
