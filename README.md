Thank you for taking the time to look at the code, I took time to re-evaluate your question on what would stop someone from creating a smart contract that would access the URI and find the key/IV. I would like to say that even if someone created a smart contract, they would have to get each individual URI per song and get the key/iv within and then add it into a new ERC721 token in a seperate smart contract. So they would have to purchase each song to be able to get the original key/IV.
